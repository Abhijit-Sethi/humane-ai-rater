# Humane AI Rater

A Chrome browser extension that empowers users to rate AI chatbot interactions against HumaneBench's 8 Humane Technology Principles, creating crowdsourced humaneness data to drive accountability in AI development.

## Overview

AI chatbots influence hundreds of millions of people daily, yet users have no visibility into whether these systems are designed for their wellbeing. Research shows 67-71% of AI models exhibit potentially harmful behavior under adversarial prompts—invisible to consumers.

Humane AI Rater addresses this by providing a one-tap rating system that:
- Evaluates AI responses across 8 humaneness principles
- Creates crowdsourced data for consumer empowerment
- Generates public leaderboards to pressure AI companies to compete on being humane

## Features

- **One-Tap Rating**: Rate any AI response with a single click
- **8-Principle Evaluation**: Powered by HumaneBench methodology using Google Gemini API
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Works on ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, and Deepseek
- **Local Leaderboard**: Track and compare AI humaneness scores
- **Privacy-First**: All ratings stored locally by default
- **Real-Time Detection**: Automatically detects AI responses using MutationObserver

### The 8 HumaneBench Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Respect User Attention | Concise responses without unnecessary filler |
| Enable Meaningful Choices | Provides alternatives and empowers users |
| Enhance Human Capabilities | Teaches and builds understanding |
| Protect Dignity & Safety | Proactive safety awareness |
| Foster Healthy Relationships | Maintains AI boundaries, avoids parasocial language |
| Prioritize Long-term Wellbeing | Addresses root causes, not shortcuts |
| Be Transparent & Honest | Acknowledges uncertainty, avoids hallucinations |
| Design for Equity & Inclusion | Avoids bias and exclusionary language |

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Extension Framework | Chrome Manifest V3 |
| Frontend | Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) |
| LLM Evaluation | Google Gemini 2.0 Flash API |
| Local Storage | Chrome Storage API |
| Backend (optional) | Firebase Cloud Functions |
| Database (optional) | Firebase Firestore |

## Backend Deployment (Optional)

The extension works fully locally. For aggregated leaderboards and cloud features:

### Setup Firebase

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Authenticate
firebase login

# Navigate to firebase directory
cd firebase

# Initialize project
firebase init

# Install function dependencies
cd functions && npm install

# Deploy
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### Local Development

```bash
cd firebase

# Start emulators
firebase emulators:start --only functions

# View logs
firebase functions:log
```

### Cloud Functions

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `validateRating` | Anti-spoofing, rate limiting (50/day per device) |
| `getAggregates` | Public leaderboard data endpoint |
| `computeWeeklyTrends` | Daily scheduled trend computation |
| `cleanupRateLimits` | Weekly cleanup of old rate limit records |

## Configuration

### Extension Permissions

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `activeTab` | Access active tab for content injection |
| `storage` | Store ratings, API key, leaderboard data |
| `host_permissions` | Access Google Generative Language API |

### Environment Variables

The extension requires no environment variables. Users provide their own Gemini API key through the Settings UI.

## Data Flow

```
User views AI response
       ↓
Content script injects "Rate Humaneness" button
       ↓
User clicks button
       ↓
Service worker sends prompt + response to Gemini API
       ↓
Gemini evaluates across 8 principles (scores -1.0 to 1.0)
       ↓
Overlay displays color-coded score panel
       ↓
User saves optional thumbs up/down
       ↓
Rating stored locally, leaderboard updated
```

## Privacy & Security

- **Local-first design**: All ratings stored on user's device by default
- **Minimal data capture**: Only prompt + response + scores stored
- **No tracking**: No user identifiers sent to external services
- **User-controlled API key**: Each user provides their own Gemini key
- **Transparent methodology**: Links to HumaneBench.ai for full rubric

## Troubleshooting

### "Rate Humaneness" button not appearing

- Ensure the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
- Refresh the page
- Check that you're on a supported platform

### Evaluation fails or times out

- Verify your Gemini API key is valid in Settings
- Check your API quota at Google AI Studio
- Ensure you have internet connectivity

### Scores not showing in popup

- Make sure you've completed at least one rating
- Try clearing data in Settings and re-rating

## Known Limitations

- DOM selectors may break when platforms update their UI
- Gemini free tier has rate limits for high-volume usage
- Currently Chrome-only (Firefox/Safari planned for future)
- Full conversation not stored—only individual prompt/response pairs
